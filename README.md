### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio website found at https://quizzical-darwin-90b565.netlify.app/
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to type faster (currently 60-80 wpm avg), code with ReactJS more efficiently (finished a udemy course), and FPS aiming with FPS aim trainers (Kovaaks is pretty cool)
